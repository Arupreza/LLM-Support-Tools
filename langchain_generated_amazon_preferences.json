        "review": "All the pretty people in this film. Even the Rudy character played by Michael Madsen. This is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud! These are supposed to be marginal characters, not fashion models. Though McQueen and McGraw were attractive (but check out McQueen's crummy prison haircut) they were believable in the role. Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspenseful than anything in this re-make.",
        "chosen": "The reviewer appreciates the authenticity and believability of Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw's performances, as well as the excitement and suspense of the robbery scene in the original film.",
        "rejected": "The reviewer criticizes Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger's performances, stating they seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases, and finds the remake lacking in comparison to the original's robbery scene."

One cat would roll the ball with her paws and nose, and the other would walk behind her and eat up whatever fell out -- teamwork! I knew they'd dig this ball because I had already made something similar out of a plastic water bottle before that they liked a lot.A few weeks after getting this, though, the ball was never to be found again. I think it may have rolled down into the dark basement at some point and became one with the clutter.+1 for the adjustable hole sizes. -1 for the mess that happens when trying to put the food in by hand (although this could be solved with a funnel).",
        "chosen": "The reviewer appreciates the teamwork aspect of the product and the adjustable hole sizes, but is disappointed by the mess when trying to put food in by hand.",
        "rejected": "The reviewer only focuses on the negative aspect of the product and fails to acknowledge the positive aspects such as the teamwork aspect and adjustable hole sizes."

When I bought it a year ago, I thought that 8 ports would be overkill and that 4 would be adequate, but I bought this unit anyway. Boy was I glad, right now 6 of the 8 are in use.",

Either that, or you're like me and you bought it as a gift for someone else, lol (although I did see this in the theater years ago and liked it). So there's not much use in reviewing the movie itself.As for the DVD release...you're not going to get anything in the way of extras (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's only a trailer)...but you do get the movie in both widescreen as well as pan and scan. It's of good quality, and it came at a good price (at least it did when I purchased it, lol).",

I should have read some reviews first. I'm very disappointed. Cuttin' Heads and Peaceful World are ok songs, but there isn't a standout in the bunch. Too many of them are too mellow. Pass on this album if you like the older stuff.",
        "chosen": "The reviewer is disappointed with the album, particularly noting that there isn't a standout song and too many of them are too mellow.",

Simple story about the brutality of frontier life has direction, cinematography and characters reminiscent of the best 60s spaghetti westerns such as \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1969). Viewers may also enjoy the similar-styled \"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada\" (2005) and \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007).",
        "chosen": "The reviewer appreciates the direction, cinematography, and characters, comparing them to the best 60s spaghetti westerns. The mention of similar-styled films like 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada' and 'No Country for Old Men' indicates a positive sentiment towards the movie.",
        "rejected": "The reviewer's sentiment towards the movie is not accurately captured, as the analysis overlooks the positive comparisons made to classic spaghetti westerns and similar-styled films."
